# Afereon Calendar #

**Calendar and Time keeping**

This calendar system marks the passing of time from a significant celestial event or a momentous awakening of celestial beings that had a profound impact on the world's history and shaped its development. Each year is counted from the first Celestial Awakening, which is considered the starting point for dating events and occurrences in the setting of your D&D campaign. For example, the current year, 1263 Celestial Awakening, signifies that 1263 years have passed since that momentous event that awakened the celestial beings and influenced the course of history in Afereon.
In the world of Afereon, the people use a unique system of naming conventions to refer to time. Instead of using the conventional terms like days, weeks, and months, they follow a system based on celestial events and seasonal changes. Here are the names they use:

- **Dawnmarks:** Each day is divided into six equal parts called "Dawnmarks." These Dawnmarks correspond to specific positions of the sun as it rises and traverses the sky. The time of day is often indicated by which Dawnmark the sun currently occupies.

- **Moonveils:** Instead of days, the people follow a cycle of eight lunar phases known as "Moonveils." These Moonveils represent the eight distinct phases of the smaller moon, such as the New Moon, Crescent Moon, Half Moon, and Full Moon. These Moonveils are referred to as Shade, Firstlight, Quartermark, Prepeak, Moonpeak, Moonfade, Fadinglight and Sliverglow.
- **Seasons:** The year is divided into four major Seasons, each corresponding to the changing climate and natural phenomena in Afereon. The Seasons are named: "Blossomtide" (Spring), "Glowshade" (Summer), "Harvestwane" (Autumn), and "Frostweave" (Winter). Each new season is marked by both moons being in the new moon phase (48 days).
