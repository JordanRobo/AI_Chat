# History of Afereon #
### 0 AE - Age of Dawn ###
Pantheons of Light and Shadow were created.

### 1 AE - Age of Elements ###
The Elemental Pantheon was created by the Deities of Light & Shadow.

### 2 AE - Age of Planar Creation ###
The 3 main planes of existence were created by the Pantheon of Elementals under the instruction and supervision of the Light and Shadow Deities.

### 4 AE - Age of Mortals ###
The first races were born into the world of Afereon. These first peoples were a less civilised and nomadic collection of races. 

### 6 AE - Age of Division ###
A great war broke out driving a divide between the Gods of Light and Shadow. "The Darkness" a deitiy from the shadow pantheon wasn't content with what had been created and viewed the mortal races as parasites on his once perfect creation. As a result they devised a scheme to manipulate the other shadow deities and overthrow the light pantheon and send Afereon into darkness and devestation.

### 46 AE - Age of Banishment ###
After 40 years of waring the other two shadow deities regained their agency and saw the power that "The Darkness" was able to weild in order to complete their goals. Growing fearful of losing their own control over their domains they struck a deal with the Gods of Light, by each of the gods sacrificing half their own power they would banish "The Darkness" in a second moon.

### 47 AE - Age of Dragons ###
The Gods, now considerably wekeaned by their banishment of "The Darkness", were fearful of what might happen should the banishment ever be broken. As a preventative measure they used their remaining strength to protect what they had created. With the help of the Elementals the Dragons were born. The Gods of Light created the Metallic Dragons, as wise keepers of knowledge and histroy, so that the world would never unleash "The Darkness" again. The Gods of Shadows created the Chromatic Dragons, strong and powerful creatures that could become the last line of defence against "The Darkness" if he was ever to break free.

### 316 AE - Age of Awakened Skies ###
This year marks the 1st celestial event after the Age of Dawn, a year people look to the skies at night and remember the sacrifices of the gods of Light and Shadow. Elves, as one of the longest living races, hold large festivals to honour and pass down the tales of the Gods. This celestial event was remembered as the Age of Awakedened Skies, noted as having 8 meteor showers over the course of the year, each meteor aligning with the peak of the 2nd moon.

### 317 AE - Age of War ###
At the start of this year a tribe of Gnomes discovered a fragment of meteor and saw it as a gift from the gods. Slowly over time they were corrupted by the meteors influence and waged a war against the Elves, who they saw as a surperior race and as a threat to their own existence. The tribe banded together with all the other Gnome tribes and as a unified force they wiped out all of Elvish civilisation. Neighbouring tribes of humans and orcs organised their own tribes to lead a resistance against the gnomes but by the time they had organised their forces it was too late, the elves were no more.

### 320 AE - Age of Advancement ###
After most of the remaining gnomes were wiped away the remaining races were fearful that one day they may face the same fate as the elves. It was this fear and a chance encouter with another meteor fragment that lead to the first city being created, Dranshould. The humans that found the meteor felt the immense power from the fragment and devised a way to cultivate and harness this power to fuel the construction of their city. Founded on the principals of meritocracy and advancement this new city shone as a beacon of hope for a better tomorrow, the past was irrelevant all that mattered was the future. The people of Dranshould have since been credited as the founders of artificing, drawing people from all over Afereon to the city full of powerful enchantments, magical tinkerers and innovation.

### 324 AE - Age of Civilisation #
This year marked the creation of two more cities and as such led to the borders of the first great nations, Mideecia, Taudaumain & Artimenia. Beinnharach was created after a group of nomadic halflings discovered a meteor fragment in the northern forests of what is now Taudaumain. The halflings believed this to be a gift of providence from the forest itself, alowing them to shapeshift and commune with nature far beyond what they had been able to before, this in turn gave birth to druidism. In a similar way Artimenia was established after a revered priestess discovered a meteor fragment while wandering the deserts on her pilgrimage. She saw this as a gift from the gods for she was finally able to converse with the gods and act as their messenger. This discovery was what led to the creation of Mirage City, a holy city built for the gods and for the people to live as they instruct thus creating the first clerics. 

### 358 AE - Age of Discovery ###
Many years passed before any of the remaining nations were founded. First was Trefenhelm, an isolated cluster of villages and communities each led by their own Jarl. Trefenhelm had already been established as an unofficial nation and cemented their identity after a small fishing vessel was blown off course, while trawling the western shores, and washed up on the coast of Mideecia. After they explored and visited the various communities they decided to bring this new school of thought to their town leader then, as they were about to set sail, they discovered a fragment of meteor washed up on the beach. Feeling that it gave off a warm radience the sailors brought it with them to keep them war on their voyage. As they sailed the crew felt an new sense of commraderie and that even without having to talk to each other, were far more in sync than had been before. This was passed on to their Jarl who, after meeting with all the other Jarls, formed a council each taking a piece of meteor for themselves to become a source of eternal fuel for their forges and a symbol of their communities newfounded identity.

### 360 AE - Age of the Seas ###
