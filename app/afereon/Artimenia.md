# Artimenia #

## *A shimmering empire emerging from the desert* ##
> Artimenia, located in the heart of the continent, is a nation that prides itself on its unwavering devotion to the divine pantheon. As a religious theocracy, its people have built their culture around faith and submission to the will of their gods, as interpreted by the grand priestess who wields immense power over the populace.

## Culture ##
- **Faith:** The cornerstone of Artimenian culture is an unyielding faith in the divine pantheon, which is comprised of various gods and goddesses. This belief system permeates all aspects of daily life, from family customs to government policies.
- **Submission to Authority:** As a theocracy, the power structure within Artimenia is heavily influenced by religious hierarchies. The grand priestess holds ultimate authority, with her word being treated as law. This has led to a culture where people blindly follow instructions from those in positions of power, believing that their leaders are divinely appointed and cannot be questioned.
- **Ignorance of History:** Under the influence of the corrupted artifact, the grand priestess has been manipulating the history taught within Artimenia. Factual events are rewritten or ignored to maintain control over the populace and prevent them from learning about past mistakes or resisting the will of their leaders.
- **Repression of Individual Thought:** In order to maintain a collective belief system, individual thought and critical thinking are discouraged in Artimenia. People who dare to question established norms or challenge religious teachings are often ostracized or punished for their nonconformity.
- **Art and Literature:** Despite the strict adherence to religious doctrine, Artimenia has produced a rich tradition of art and literature that reflects its culture's focus on faith and devotion. Religious iconography can be found throughout the nation, with elaborate temples and shrines dedicated to various deities. Additionally, hymns, prayers, and songs are composed to celebrate divine figures or recount religious narratives.
- **Racial Tensions:** Artimenia's history of conflicts against races that live for long periods of time has left a lasting impact on its culture. The people harbour deep-seated prejudices against these "immortal" races, often blaming them for past misfortunes and believing that their presence brings ill fortune upon the nation.

## Summary ##
